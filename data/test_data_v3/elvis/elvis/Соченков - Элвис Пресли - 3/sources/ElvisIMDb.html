        <div class="soda odd">
          <p>
          Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, to <a href="/name/nm0696175?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Gladys Presley</a> (née Gladys Love Smith) and <a href="/name/nm0696184?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Vernon Presley</a> (Vernon Elvis Presley). He had a twin brother who was stillborn. In 1948, Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee where he attended Humes High School. In 1953, he attended the senior prom with the current girl he was courting, Regis Wilson. After graduating from high school in Memphis, Elvis took odd jobs working as a movie theater usher and a truck driver for Crown Electric Company. He began singing locally as "The Hillbilly Cat", then signed with a local recording company, and then with RCA in 1955.<br /><br />Elvis did much to establish early rock and roll music. He began his career as a performer of rockabilly, an up-tempo fusion of country music and rhythm and blues, with a strong backbeat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing 'black' and 'white' sounds, made him popular - and controversial - as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like "Jailhouse Rock" and "Hound Dog" later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop music. Teenage girls became hysterical over his blatantly sexual gyrations, particularly the one that got him nicknamed "Elvis the Pelvis" (television cameras were not permitted to film below his waist).<br /><br />In 1956, following his six television appearances on The Dorsey Brothers' "Stage Show", Elvis was cast in his first acting role, in a supporting part in <a href="/title/tt0049452?ref_=nmbio_mbio">&#1051;&#1102;&#1073;&#1080; &#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1103; &#1085;&#1077;&#1078;&#1085;&#1086;</a> (1956), the first of 33 movies he starred in.<br /><br />In 1958, Elvis was drafted into the military, and relocated to Bad Nauheim, Germany. There he met 14-year old army damsel Priscilla Ann Wagner (<a href="/name/nm0001636?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Priscilla Presley</a>), whom he would eventually marry after an eight-year courtship, and by whom he had his only child, <a href="/name/nm1070086?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Lisa Marie Presley</a>. Elvis' military service and the "British Invasion" of the 1960s reduced his concerts, though not his movie/recording income.<br /><br />Through the 1960s, Elvis settled in Hollywood, where he starred in the majority of his thirty-three movies, mainly musicals, acting alongside some of the most well known actors in Hollywood. Critics panned most of his films, but they did very well at the box office, earning upwards of $150 million total. His last fiction film, <a href="/title/tt0065537?ref_=nmbio_mbio">&#1055;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080; &#1086;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1095;&#1100;&#1077;</a> (1969), deals with several social issues; romance within the clergy, an autistic child, almost unheard of in 1969, rape, and mob violence. It has recently received critical acclaim.<br /><br />Elvis made a comeback in the 1970s with live concert appearances starting in early 1970 in Las Vegas with over 57 sold-out shows. He toured throughout the United States, appearing on-stage in over 500 live appearances, many of them sold out shows. His marriage ended in divorce, and the stress of constantly traveling as well as his increasing weight gain and dependence upon stimulants and depressants took their toll.<br /><br />Elvis Presley died at age 42 on August 16, 1977 at his mansion in Graceland, near Memphis, shocking his fans worldwide. At the time of his death, he had sold more than 600 million singles and albums. Since his death, Graceland has become a shrine for millions of followers worldwide. Elvis impersonators and purported sightings have become stock subjects for humorists. To date, Elvis Presley is the only performer to have been inducted into three separate music 'Halls of Fame'. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales, and remains one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music.<br />

Jones, nearly as awestruck as Plant, made small talk with the "King," and mentioned what a beautiful watch Elvis wore.

      He was drafted into the US Army in 1958, stationed in West Germany and discharged in 1960, achieving the rank of sergeant. His being in the army was a public relations headache, according to army documents released by the Pentagon on Thursday, June 9, 2005. "Elvis Presley will not be released in a manner different from any other inductee serving overseas," the Army's adjutant general wrote to citizens who complained following reports that the rock icon would get an early "good behavior" discharge. When he entered the army at Memphis, Tennessee, on March 24, 1958, there was a public outcry from his fans, and protests flowed to Washington, including a hand-written plea released by the National Archives and Records Administration. "Dear Mamie," one correspondent wrote to then First Lady <a href="/name/nm0252034?ref_=nmbio_trv_57">Mamie Eisenhower</a>. "Will you please, please be so sweet and kind as to ask Ike [President <a href="/name/nm0252032?ref_=nmbio_trv_57">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>] to please bring Elvis Presley back to us from the Army? We need him in our entertainment world to make us all laugh." A 1959 Army memo set out the Presley problem: "When Private First Class Presley was first inducted, there was considerable adverse public reaction . . . alleging that he would receive preferential treatment in the Army. This impression has been largely replaced by a public impression of a good soldier serving his military obligation . . . Many teenagers who look up to and emulate Private First Class Presley will . . . follow his example in the performance of their military service".<br />

      While he never joined any political party, his political views were somewhat mixed. During the early 1960s he was an outspoken admirer of liberal President <a href="/name/nm0448123?ref_=nmbio_trv_160">John F. Kennedy</a>. He later confessed to "weeping openly" at the news of Kennedy's death. Later in life, however, he made a more conservative move on the political spectrum. He began singing the praises of President <a href="/name/nm0633271?ref_=nmbio_trv_160">Richard Nixon</a>, and his right-wing streak culminated in a visit to the White House in December 1970. During the visit, Presley was photographed giving the President a handgun, which was (for security reasons) presented but not given. Presley spoke of his admiration for Nixon, revealed his disgust at the hippie counterculture, spoke disparagingly of <a href="/name/nm1397313?ref_=nmbio_trv_160">The Beatles</a> (he said that having earned their money in America, they had then left for England to promote "anti-American" feelings), fervently expressed his patriotism, offered to infiltrate and go undercover in left-wing hippie groups, asked to be appointed a federal narcotics agent, and even hugged the president twice. Nixon, for his part, was not sure if Presley was serious or not, but granted his request and made him an honorary federal agent. Nixon said he was equally parts bewildered and amused by the encounter, thanked Presley for his support, and the picture of the duo has become one of the most famous photos taken in the White House. On Presley's death in 1977, the former president asked Americans to lower their flags all over the country as a mark of respect.<br />

Even more amazing was that Elvis' prestigious record label, RCA Victor, was a subsidiary of the corporation that owned NBC. The NBC logo at that time was the famous RCA Color (TV) Peacock. Elvis already had sold at least five million records for RCA. Allen would later state that his reason for "giving away" Elvis was that he ran strictly a comedy show.

      "I'll Be Home For Christmas", was the original closing number for Elvis' special, <a href="/title/tt0285063?ref_=nmbio_trv_207">&#1069;&#1083;&#1074;&#1080;&#1089;</a> (1968). On previous occasions he headlined Christmas specials that were aired on radio stations throughout the Southern US. Producer <a href="/name/nm0004596?ref_=nmbio_trv_207">Steve Binder</a> and Elvis decided that a song that reflected the turbulence of the 1960s, and at the same time gave a plea for hope and understanding, would be more appropriate than a Christmas ballad to end the show. <a href="/name/nm1039058?ref_=nmbio_trv_207">Earl Brown</a>, the show's Musical Director, was asked by Binder to go home and write such a song. He did just that and composed, on short notice, "If I Can Dream", with its reference to <a href="/name/nm0455052?ref_=nmbio_trv_207">Martin Luther King</a>'s 1963 "I Have A Dream" speech, given in Washington, DC. Brown's newly composed song contained the lyrics, "If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand". With minimal rehearsing and no demo to work with, Elvis' spontaneous live performance of the new closing song was released as his next million-selling single, peaking at #13 on the US pop charts. The success of "If I Can Dream" led the way for Elvis to record other songs with social issues, such as "In the Ghetto", "Clean Up Your Own Backyard" and "Don't Cry Daddy".<br />

      Although <a href="/name/nm0001168?ref_=nmbio_trv_211">Bob Dylan</a> enormously admired him, Elvis was disparaging of Dylan, especially in terms of his singing voice. Once he was said to privately quip, "My mouth's so dry, feels like Bob Dylan slept in it". Later, however, he recorded a cover of Dylan's song, "Tomorrow is a Long Time". Elvis reportedly disliked much of the 1960s popular music, including <a href="/name/nm1397313?ref_=nmbio_trv_211">The Beatles</a>, because he associated it with the "drug culture", although he did freely cover songs by many such bands.<br />
